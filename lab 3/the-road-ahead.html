                    Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a
                    recent
                    wind
                    of their white covering of frost,
                    and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence
                    reigned
                    over the land. The land itself was a desolation,
                    lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness.
                    There
                    was a
                    hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more
                    terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold
                    as
                    the
                    frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility.
                    It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the
                    effort
                    of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted
                    Northland Wild.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of
                    wolfish
                    dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths,
                    spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into
                    crystals
                    of
                    frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged
                    along
                    behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested
                    on
                    the
                    snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the
                    bore
                    of
                    soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow
                    oblong
                    box.
                    There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but
                    prominent,
                    occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second
                    man. On
                    the
                    sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten
                    down
                    until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life
                    is an
                    offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the
                    water
                    to
                    prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their
                    mighty
                    hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission
                    man—man
                    who
                    is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end
                    come
                    to
                    the cessation of movement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their
                    bodies
                    were
                    covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the
                    crystals
                    from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming of
                    ghostly
                    masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were
                    men,
                    penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal
                    adventure,
                    pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of
                    space.
